    <p>You have found the most excellent Web-Hosted Ledger of Journals of the individual known as Nathaniel Wheeler for
      Boise CodeWorks.</p>
    <p>Here are some bullet points that illustrate aspects of my personality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I was recently married.</li>
      <li>The honeymoon was Europe.</li>
      <li>It was pretty great.</li>
      <li><em>Utrecht, Netherlands</em> is a pretty nice place.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I really want to learn how to force HTML to put double spaces after full stops. Because that is the correct way.

    <p>I am now at the end of two weeks in the Boise CodeWorks program. I have learned many things, such as why
      Bootstrap is so widely used. I quite like how the 12-column I have learned that often, it's better to just get
      some javascript to program your
      webpage <em>for</em> you by using HTML templates. I like this trick quite a lot, and I hope to utilize it
      efficiently.</p>
    <p>Arrays have been a struggle. Looping them efficiently even more so.</p>
