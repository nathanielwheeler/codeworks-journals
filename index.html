    What is up my dude?
  </h1>
  <p>You have found the most excellent Web-Hosted Ledger of Journals of the individual known as Nathaniel Wheeler for
    Boise CodeWorks.</p>
  <p>Here are some bullet points that illustrate aspects of my personality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I was recently married.</li>
    <li>The honeymoon was Europe.</li>
    <li>It was pretty great.</li>
    <li><em>Utrecht, Netherlands</em> is a pretty nice place.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I really want to learn how to force HTML to put double spaces after full stops. Because that is the correct way.
